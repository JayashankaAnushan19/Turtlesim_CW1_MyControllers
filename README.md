# Turtlesim_CW1_MyControllers

Coursework 01 for Mudule: PDE4430 Mobile Robotics 2024-2025.Tasks to be complete as follows;
1 - Teleoperation using the keyboard, with an option to change movement speed  
2 - Autonomous navigation to any given coordinate in the Turtlesim window 
3 - Avoiding wall collision – Override movement if wall hitting is imminent
4 - Vacuum Cleaning behaviour – Covering the entire window in an efficient manner 
5 - Multiple turtles vacuum cleaning behaviour – 2 is good, 3 or more is great 


## Task 01 - Teleoperation using the keyboard, with an option to change movement speed  

*Note:* This project involves modifying/recreate the `turtlesim_teleop_key` control script to include a speed control option and keyboard inputs for enhanced control of the turtlesim simulation.
    1. **Objective:** Recreate the in-built turtlesim_teleop_key script with added functionalities:
        - Speed Control: Allow dynamic adjustment of the turtle's movement speed.   
        - Enhanced Keyboard Controls: Implement custom keyboard inputs for better control.
    2. **Implementation Language:** Python
    3. **Python Version:** This project is intended for `Python 3.8.10`, as per the original author's specification.
